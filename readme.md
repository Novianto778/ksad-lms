Branching Strategy
We follow this branching strategy for our collaborative development process. Here's an overview of our branches:

main: Represents the production-ready code.
develop: Integration branch for ongoing development.
feature/{feature-name}: Individual branches for each feature.
hotfix/{issue}: Branches created to fix critical issues.
Collaboration Workflow
Clone the repository:

Run git clone https://github.com/Novianto778/ksad-lms.git to clone the repository to your local machine.
Create a new branch:

For a feature: Run git branch feature/{feature-name} and switch to the new branch using git checkout feature/{feature-name}.
For a release or hotfix: Follow a similar process, replacing feature with release or hotfix accordingly.
Work on your assigned tasks:

Make changes to the codebase in your branch.
Commit your changes using git commit with descriptive commit messages.
Push your changes:

Push your branch to the remote repository using git push origin {branch-name}.
Pull requests (PR):

When your feature is complete, create a PR on GitHub to merge your branch into the develop branch.
Assign relevant team members as reviewers for the PR.
Address any feedback or suggested changes during the code review process.
Merge and integration:

Once the PR is approved, merge it into the develop branch.
Regularly integrate the develop branch into a staging environment for testing and integration.
Releases and deployments:

Perform final testing on release branches before merging into main.
Tag the merged main branch with the appropriate version number.
Hotfixes:

Create hotfix branches from main to address critical issues.
Merge the hotfix into both main and develop branches.
